# TwitterBlessingBot
I have always Tweeted "Today is a blessing ❤️" since 2020.
It has been an affirmation and affirmation for those who engage with my tweet.

## Problem
I tweet too late or too early

## Solution
I made a Twitter bot using Python and the twitter Api to Tweet this for me

## Automation
I could have written a line or two to automate it, but I decided to use a cloud service cron job (scheduler) to do the automation


### You can fork the script (I will update this README.md with the medium blog post on how I set everything up)

### Thank you
